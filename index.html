            Full-stack software developer, creative thinker, and problem solver.
            I have a background in education, music, and arts technology, with
            skills in improvisation and the ability to quickly grasp new ideas
            and integrate them into high-quality results. I value education and
            helping those around me realize their potential.

            and the collaborative dynamics of working alongside fellow
            developers on a team.
